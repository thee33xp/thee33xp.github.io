        <h4>The Military-Industrial Complex</h4>
        <p>Foreward: I started writing this on July 20th, 2024. I had heard the speech before but I gave
            it a thorough listen prior to beginning my first draft. Since then, I've taken on other projects
            and whatnot becoming distracted from this idea of breaking down these historical speeches and their implications.
            As I've started to put this site together, I've decided to give the speeches a listen again and 
            will continue updating these drafts as the opportunity is presented.

            President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave his farewell address to the nation.
            During the speech he shared a few, solemn thoughts, with the audience, as he explained the standing 
            America now had, on the world stage. This American might was not solely due to the material prosperity
            of the country, nor to the military strength; but to the dependence of prestige and leadership 
            mindful of balance while using this strength within the international community. He spoke of the 4 
            major wars the world had found itself in over the course of the last half century, and the 
            responsibility we, as a nation, had to continue the pursuit of progressing world peace and bettering 
            mankind. That the basic purpose of our experiment in free government has been, and should continue 
            to be, the fostering of progress in human achievement and the enhancement of Liberty, Dignity, 
            and Integrity amongst peoples and nations. He also stated that anything less than this continued 
            pursuit, would be unworthy of a free and religious people, ultimately leading to grievous hurt felt 
            by the people home and abroad. 
            </p>
        <p>
            Furthering his explanation of balance in pursuit of progress, Eisenhower cautions us with a dire
            warning of future crises engulfed by the ideology of those who would wish to remove these freedoms.
            The pursuit of these noble goals is, and will be, consistently threatened, as he describes us,
            facing “... a hostile ideology, global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose,
            and insidious in method.” In meeting these threats, Eisenhower advises us to avoid the temptation
            of reactionary measures without counsel of a broader scope first. He signifies the dangers inherent 
            in irrational responses associated with singular solution thinking and points towards consideration
            in the need of balance within the economy, current and future prospects of the nation, and the 
            government's duty to the people and the duties it imposes on them. “Good judgment seeks balance 
            in progress. Lack of it, eventually finds imbalance and frustration.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            Of the general looming threats 
            Eisenhower warns of, he mentions two specifically by name. The military industrial complex being the 
            first, being the cause of costly overspending regarding the national defense budget. He pointed to 
            the fact that more money was spent annually, on defense and security, than the net income of all U.S. 
            corporations combined. He spoke on how massive the arms industry had become since the start of the 
            century, as it was unprecedented and extremely influential, he recognized the imperative need for 
            this development while also sharing a warning to the public hoping they would comprehend its 
            potentially grave implications. The second specific warning Eisenhower gave in his farewell address, 
            is time and an avoidance of the impulse to live only for the moment rather than planting seeds 
            for future generations. He stated that by ignoring the long term impacts of policy, the precious 
            material resources of tomorrow would be plundered and the heritage of their grandchildren would be 
            lost. He hoped “democracy would survive for all generations to come and not become an insolvent 
            Phantom of tomorrow.” He was worried public policy could become captive of a scientific and 
            technological elite class, and that it was the responsibility of statesmen to integrate these 
            discoveries and technologies within the principles of our democratic system, consistent with the 
            supreme goals of our free society.
