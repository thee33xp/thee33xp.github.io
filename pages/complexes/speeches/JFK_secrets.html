        <h4>Secret Societies</h4>
        <p>Foreward: I started writing this on/around July 20th, 2024. I had heard the speech before but I gave
            it a thorough listen prior to beginning my first draft. Since then, I've taken on other projects
            and whatnot becoming distracted from this idea of breaking down these historical speeches and their implications.
            As I've started to put this site together, I've decided to give the speeches a listen again and 
            will continue updating these drafts as the opportunity is presented.
        </p>
        <p>Update: I plan on adding to this soon. Specifically after I do further research into the 
            Bay of Pigs incident. Thank you for your patience.

        <h5>
            April 27th, 1961

        </h5>
        <p>
            The newly elected President John F. Kennedy gave an address to the American Newspaper Publishers Association,
            where he emphasized the importance of transparency within a free society and shared the same concerns his 
            predecessor had, being the importance of balance between national security and the threats to it. 
            Kennedy specifically addresses the threats that government secrecy can cause eventually leading to erosion 
            of public trust. He called for a change of outlook by those who would act against the progress of America’s 
            supreme goals and a reconsideration of governmental mission tactics. 
            </p>
        <p>   
            He asked those who stand for the 
            principles of this nation, to band together in recognition of a large global threat of “...a monolithic 
            and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence.” 
            Kennedy, recognizing and addressing the overwhelming threat imposed by secret societies in his speech 
            states “It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a 
            tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, 
            scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. 
            Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. 
            No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.”
            </p>
        <p>
            The second thing Kennedy asks of the audience is “...to inform and alert the American people. 
            To make certain that they possess all the facts they need, and understand them as well. 
            The perils, the prospects, the purposes of our program and the choices that we face.” 
            He says “No president should fear public scrutiny of his program. For from that scrutiny comes 
            understanding; and from that understanding comes support or opposition. And both are necessary.” 
            Concluding the speech JFK remarks “Now the links between the nations first forged by the compass 
            have made us all citizens of the world, the hopes and threats of one becoming the hopes and threats 
            of us all.”
