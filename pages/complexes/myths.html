        <h4><a class="pro-link" href="MYTHOS/TGP.html">Mysteries of The Great Pyramids</a>
        </h4>  
        <p>Are the Great Pyramids as old as scholars claim, or could they be far older than we imagine?
            Also, how were they built? Theories range from thousands of labors to the use of ancient 
            technologies! Let's break down one of the world's greatest architectural engimas.

        <h4><a class="pro-link" href="MYTHOS/TGF.html">The Great Flood</a>
        </h4>  
        <p>From ancient Sumer to the Bible, cultures all around the world tell strikingly similar
            tales of a devastating flood that reshaped the earth and human civilization. Is this myth rooted
            in reality, or does it symbolize something else entirely? 
        </p> 
        <h4><a class="pro-link" href="MYTHOS/TGC.html">Creation Stories</a>
        </h4>  
        <p>From the cosmic eggs of Hindu mythology to the epic battles of the Norse gods,
            humanity has tried to offer a glimpse into how we understand the world around us-where does
            your story of creation begin?
        </p>    
        
        <h4><a class="pro-link" href="MYTHOS/TGS.html">Death and Taxes</a>
        </h4>  
        <p>
            In a world where hardship and uncertainty are the only two constants, we're left
            to confront life's inevitabilities. Uncover why choosing the harder path, though less traveled,
            leads to true strength and purpose.
        </p>
        <h4><a class="pro-link" href="MYTHOS/TGE.html">Exploitation</a>
        </h4>  
        <p>Propaganda, Manipulation, Power, & War. Modern economic challenges point to a broad
            exploitation that traps individuals in a system of financial dependency, ran by a centralized 
            bureaucracy with no regard for their health.
