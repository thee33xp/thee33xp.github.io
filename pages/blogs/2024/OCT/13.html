        <h4>Blog Entry:</h4>
        <p>I've started building the index page with the site named "Gnosis Arcana". This is open to be
            changed eventually. There is also a quote under the header, If I can, I'd like to change this 
            quote on a daily basis if possible; but, I think while using GitHub's Pages as my host for the 
            site, I see an issue (due to it being a static site)
            with the daily quote change unless creating a python program to interface 
            with Jekyll, GitHub's default for page building. </p>
        <p>I want to start adding links to the index page.</p>
        <h5>I'm gonna need:</h5>
        

        <p>- INDEX, PROJECTS, BLOG, Complex, GAMES...</p>
            
        <p>I probably should move everything useful to a seperate folder? start organizing properlike...</p>
        <p>... I didn't move, I deleted all previous html and css examples not needed for the project atm.</p>
        <h5>Hours Later...</h5>
        <p>I've gotten the basics for the Complex "speeches" subdir, as well as,
            the layout for the index and the games index with a  JavaScript Platformer
            test game. I'd like to add a few more pieces to the Complex Index because right now it 
            only has the one subdir. I'm thinking of adding links to:</p>
        <p>- Federal Reserve, 1913
            - War.
            - Drugs
            - Alphabet agencies... DEA, FDA, DEI, DIE...

            - Aliens and Space tech.
            - The Great Flood
            - Creation

            - Trump? lol... maybe not.
            Farout shish-ka-roberts.</p>
        <p>So in closing:
            Continue adding links to the complex. Finish the pages for Blog and Projects.
            Also, add a return button to each page within a subdir to return to the dir started
            from... so if in speeches within complex. at end of specific speech has return button.</p>
