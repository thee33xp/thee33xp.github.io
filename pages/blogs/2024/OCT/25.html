        <h5>War Is A Racket</h5>
        <p>
            Smedley Darlington Butler, a U.S. Marine Corps major general and two-time Medal of Honor 
            recipient, is remembered not only for his extraordinary military service but also for his 
            later years as an outspoken critic of war and imperialism. At the time of his death in 1940, 
            Butler was the most decorated Marine in U.S. history, having served in numerous interventions 
            across the Caribbean, Latin America, and Asia during an era of aggressive American expansion. 
            His extensive service gave him firsthand exposure to the often hidden motivations behind 
            military action, which he would later condemn in his famous speech and essay titled War is a 
            Racket.

            “I was a 
            racketeer for capitalism...”

        </h5>
        

        
        <p>
            A key turning point in Butler’s activism came in the 1930s, with what has come to be known as 
            the “Business Plot.” Butler testified before Congress that he had been approached by a group of 
            wealthy businessmen and financiers who wanted him to lead a coup to overthrow President 
            Franklin D. Roosevelt and install a fascist-style regime. Butler’s outspoken refusal and 
            testimony brought the plot into public awareness, exposing an alarming threat from within 
            and confirming for him the dangers of unchecked corporate power.

        </p>

            Butler’s experiences, combined with his disgust at the plot and his growing awareness of 
            the corrupting influence of private profit in military affairs, led him to publish War is 
            a Racket. In it, he argued that war primarily served the interests of a wealthy few at the 
            expense of the masses, describing it as a “racket” that enriches corporations while soldiers 
            pay the ultimate price. His condemnation of what he saw as “the only one in which the profits 
            are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives” resonated deeply and continues to be a powerful 
            critique of militarism and corporate influence.

        </p>

            Through his personal transformation from decorated hero to critic, Butler highlighted the 
            ethical complexities of military service and shed light on the underpinnings of American 
            imperialism. His life and words remain a potent reminder of the importance of scrutinizing 
            the true motives behind war and questioning the interests it ultimately serves.
