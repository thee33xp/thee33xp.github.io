        <p>We can only exist, in this 3-dimensional physical space, as unique individuals, due to time. 
            Time is the measure of all things including, and outside, the realm of all our social systems 
            (including all the scientific disciplines).</p>


        <p>Our mind (or “Spirit”, or “Soul”, or all three combined), I believe, has the capacity to 
            exist outside of this limited physical space time and reside in [perceive of] lower and higher
             dimensional realms.
              If this perceptible reality is a light fragmentation of a holographic universe 
              from a higher dimensional plane, separating from one light source into many different 
              spectrums, then our trinity of “mind/soul/body” would potentially, not be limited to this 
              physical plane, as our physical bodies are; but, be able to transcend these distinct realms.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The third eye or “seat of the soul” is represented in many ancient cultures as a pinecone, 
            potentially because they knew that we do not perceive reality, solely, through our eyes but 
            from a central control point, meeting between the two hemispheres of the brain and atop the 
            spinal cord. The center of the brain, or the pineal gland could be where the mind resides, 
            where our imagination and ability to think in complicated, multidimensional spaces is derived, 
            as well as, our connection point between our navigation of this physically limited plane of 
            existence and the infinite divine light source or Godhead. All visible light observable through 
            the human eye is just a vibrational frequency, or waves, about 0.0035 percent of the 
            electromagnetic radiation spectrum, our eyes capture these lightwaves and produce the 
            image at the back of our brain in the visual cortex. Different input sensory information 
            is taken from the outside world and discriminated against to contrive our vivid imitations 
            of the objective. During our physical incarnation, we’re separated from this Godhead and 
            undergo a loss of awareness of this spiritual connectedness due to our central nervous system’s 
            repeated process of believing its own illusion. +

        <p>
            We start as a single inseminated egg and almost in a magical fashion, our cells follow meiosis, 
            The light of life is breathed into these formidable beings through a wormhole of some 
            etheric realm beyond the fabric of our spacetime. This electromagnetic energy transfer 
            forms a hyperboloid structure further creating a torus field of energy and providing us 
            with the duality of magnetism and the electrical universal workings. Shielded from the 
            external world and tethered to our mothers like a ship to a dock, we are shaped according 
            to this mysterious law of nature until time we arrive. Just as we are cut from our maternal 
            connection after birth, through being born we are disconnected from our etheric roots. 
            Although physically separate, we are seemingly still linked in a far more puzzling and 
            complex manner than a system in which we can observe. Only by removing ourselves from 
            the exterior world and seeking inward can we recognize this interconnectedness and psychic 
            ability far more powerful and objective than secular belief. We fractally branch off from 
            our parents and physically manifest into this world on a quest of continuation and replication, 
            independent fragments of the whole source Godhead. A single light fragmented into a radiant 
            spectrum, each one carrying information linking it back to the origin.  Our ancestral lineage 
            similarly corresponds with this fractal branching, as we stand on our forefathers shoulders 
            in order to progress the whole forward. We carry the light of life inside us, stemming back 
            to before physically manifesting, we are made up of the same cosmic material that created 
            the conditions for us to even perceive existence. In essence, we are the universe observing 
            upon itself. Limited, however still engaged.</p>
        <p>
            Our finite time here in our unique, independent existences creates a sense of legitimacy  
            that we are separate from the whole. Our physical vessels may age, fail, and our light may 
            leave our bodies, but as the old saying goes: “Energy cannot be created, nor destroyed, 
            only transformed or converted from one form to another.” After passing from this realm 
            back to whence we came, anything may be possible. It’s hard to clearly grasp what would 
            be perceptible, in a sort of tesseract, outside of 3-dimensional spacetime. Part of what 
            makes this hard to comprehend is the fact that time is the single factor that establishes 
            our understanding of life and that limitation becomes a vicious perception blocker when 
            trying to delve into the realms outside of it. An attempt at omnipresent sight through 
            our existence is counterintuitive but might also be a step in the right direction because 
            what is found is that time is a mental construct of the mind. The truth is that the present, 
            now, is the only that has ever existed and will ever exist.</p>
        
        
        <p>
            Mathematics, Scientific notions, and Language development are cultural definitions 
            and agreements with the intention to understand the world around us, to bring the macro 
            down to the micro. We impose logic on the unfathomable workings of the universe, 
            ultimately forgetting what it truly is, and are not able to fit cleanly in the box 
            with which we define it.</p>
        <p>
            Cells communicate with a data rate efficiency far beyond our own mind’s ability to comprehend 
            information. Atoms are attracted through intermolecular forces to form molecules, monomers, 
            intramolecular forces form macromolecules, or polymers,  such as proteins, DNA, and RNA. 
            The building blocks of life are subject to magnetic, chemical, and electrical dualistic laws 
            it must follow. Why do we perceive ourselves as separate?
        </p>
        <p>
            Theoretically, the light source, Godhead, could exist beyond our veil of observation, 
            within the confines of the cosmic microwave background, prior to the recombination epoch 
            that occurred after the big bang, eventually leading to photons being able to escape from 
            the primordial plasmic soup. If time is confined to existence only within gravitational 
            fields, then what we’re seeing 13 billion years ago in the CMB imaging could be a proof 
            of our metaphorical clock striking one as to say, “time has started”. 
            The whole universe is created out of vibrational frequencies, from the subatomic forces 
            to the gravitational pull of the planets. We have the power to harness those vibrational 
            frequencies through our vocal cords. To speak life and death upon one another, to bring these 
            distant notions of heaven and hell to the present. Everything is like a rippling pond. 
            Going out far and then back inwards. Karmic resonance not just in actions but even in intent. 
            That is why the ancient texts speak about just having hatred in your heart being akin to murder.
             I think it’s a reference to the electromagnetic frequencies put off by our hearts. 
             What is above, is below, is within, and without. We manifest our destiny with every 
             move we make. It’s important to move with intention and discernment. </p>

            ^(it could be interpreted that a higher intelligence species manipulated our DNA by splicing 
            the 2nd and 3rd chromosomes into one, effectively reducing our total count from 48 to 46.)
        <p>
            This type of gene manipulation could also be the explanation for the garden of Eden story, 
            whereas “first man” Adam was formed out of dust, “breathed” life into by our creator 
            figure and later is taken to what seems to be an outdoor laboratory where scientific 
            experiments and analysis was conducted on early mankind. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar creation stories can be found in ancient Sumeria, Akkadia, and Babylonia including 
            the myth of “Adapa”, the Seven Tablets of Creation, the cuneiform Enuma Elish, 
            and the Epic of Atrahasis. These stories exhibit an ancient understanding of where 
            we came from and the rulers of the world at that time. They also describe a higher 
            intelligence race from another world who come to earth on a mining expedition for gold, 
            eventually having a revolt within their master class and worker class and compromised by 
            genetically manipulating the existing beings on earth by giving them their “essence”. 
            These “Annunaki” rulers established a base of operations in “Eridu”  and eventually came 
            to rule over their existing workers as well as the rest of earth. Enlil and Enki are brothers 
            referred to in these different cultural stories, sometimes being referred to by different names 
            but, where Enlil wants to enslave humanity, Enki wants to save us. That is when they had a 
            falling out because Enki gave us an unlockable ability that could be more powerful than even 
            these “anunnaki” gods had. That is why Enki is depicted as the biblical snake in the garden 
            deceiving humanity to take part in the fruit of knowledge of good and evil because he went 
            against Enlil’s wishes to enslave and rule over us.  A man named “Adapa” also resided in 
            Eridu and possible parallel connections to “Adam” include similar names with root word, 
            both accounts include a test involving consumption of “deadly food” and both are summoned 
            before God to account for their transgressions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar genetic engineering stories can be found in the Egyptian book of the dead where it 
            is told the Goddess Isis artificially brings an egg to term in her “womb”. 
            These tainted truths about ancient civilizations artificially inseminating and genetically 
            manipulating humanity, if taken with any weight, seem to tell us that we have lost some 
            technology or knowledge over the course of time and we’re trying to rediscover it. 
            What if these ancient cultures had a deeper connection to the earth as well as the 
            universal laws that govern us? What if, as Graham Handcock would say, “We are a species 
            with amnesia.”? What if these ancient megalithic sites such as: The Great Pyramids, 
            Gobeklitepe, the Richat structure, and so many others are telling us something about 
            our past? Did they have a higher level of intelligence and depth of knowledge than we 
            do today? It certainly seems they recognized the metaphysical connectedness in the fabric 
            of our reality better than secular society does today. 
            These ancient tales might not be just allegories, reflecting questions the oldest of us 
            (peoples of mankind) were asking but, also literal truths, translated with veils of 
            subjectivity, miscommunicating or even intentionally organizing to corrupt the objectionable 
            events.
