        <p>Fractal gifts

            I’m not big nor small, but perfect, relative to my environment. (Fractal Branching)
        
            Are we intelligent? What does that mean? The more layers pulled back to expose the roots of our origins and consciousness, the more room is left up for interpretation, biases, and subjective determination. All these profound questions about our place in the universe, does the answer really matter? Isn’t the asking of the question worth more?
            I was told once by a friend, when I was struggling with the concept of an afterlife due to a different friend passing, that the journey is more important than the destination in this existence. Even thinking about it now can bring me to tears in its philosophical depth. The destination is formed by the journey, the journey is formed by what we choose to do with the gift, our present time. I think that’s probably why most people don’t like it when others act entitled, it disturbs us at a core level when someone gets what they do not deserve. Aetheric justice and balance is fundamentally ingrained in us. It’s true on both sides of the coin. Most of us don’t want someone to be falsely accused and imprisoned. We want you to get what you earn, good or bad. No handouts. 
            If “God” or “creator” did intelligently design this computer simulation we call the “universe” and our consciousness could just be equated to some 
        low-level artificial intelligence, what would change? Nothing really. Our time here is still the unique identifier differentiating this experience from everyone else’s. In some way we are all fractal branches of the source code perceiving the same experience at different pathways… beautiful. Or we could just all be trapped in a simulation created by some egomaniacal, narcissistic, alien high schooler that is keeping our universe on some hard drive in his alien moms basement and our “loving” god is really just a punk. Who knows? Maybe not knowing the destination can be a good thing. Sometimes you might not want all the answers once you have them.
            I’d love to have a good reason for why bad things happen to undeserving people or why some people do evil deeds; but, I can’t come up with a good answer. Free will? It’s the adversity and struggle that molds our character? These are nice answers but it doesn’t seem like the right one. It doesn’t explain away the absolute chaos and madness that this existence is. Sometimes it feels that the meaning derives from the proclamation of itself. That we need to give it some sort of meaning to avoid becoming nihilistic. That’s a scary thought: there is no meaning, you just live and die and are eventually forgotten. I don’t personally choose to apply such a lack of definition to my own life; however, I do recognize that on a large enough cosmic scale, everything will eventually be wiped away and erased. Ultimately, that's why we need to pursue love, life, liberty, and happiness because no matter how good or bad you’re doing in this moment of your life: This too shall pass.
